As you can see converting an RTSP stream to HLS might not be the easiest task, however, some understanding of the protocol and the usage of a couple of prefabricated elements in the Membrane Framework make up a rather compact solution, which is open for extension and modification.

Such a converter will be of use whenever we are dealing with an RTSP stream, most likely coming from surveillance or videoconferencing camera.

We hope that you grasped the basic idea of the RTSP protocol and how does an RTSP to HLS converter created using Membrane Framework looks like.
